# Pre-Consultation Guide

This Next.js application helps patients prepare for doctor consultations by generating personalized precautions based on their symptoms and the type of doctor they are seeing. Users can also interact with an AI-powered MediAgent to get further assistance and clarification on their precautions.

Key Features:

- **Symptom-Based Precautions:** Generates tailored precautions based on user-provided symptoms and selected doctor type.
- **Interactive MediAgent:** Provides a chat-based interface for users to ask follow-up questions and receive further guidance.
- **Previous Medical Reports:** Allows users to upload previous medical reports to enhance the accuracy of personalized precautions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers a clean and intuitive design for seamless navigation and interaction.

## My Journey Building a Pre-Consultation Guide with AI

### Inspiration
My inspiration for this project came from a desire to make healthcare more accessible and less intimidating for patients. Doctor consultations can often be overwhelming, and patients may not always know the right questions to ask or the precautions to take beforehand. I wanted to leverage the power of AI to empower patients with personalized information, helping them feel more prepared and confident during their consultations.
